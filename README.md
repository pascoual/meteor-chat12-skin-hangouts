## Contributing
Contributors are very welcome. There are many things you can help with,
including adding testing feature, creating examples for the examples folder...
Some guidelines below:

* **Questions**: It's okay to ask a question on Github Issues if you're
	having trouble since the volume is manageable. Just prefix your Github Issue with
	'Question: ' so we can differentiate easily. Also, please make sure you've read through
	PDFTk documentation and tried a few things before asking. This way you can be very
	specific in your question. Also, please provide a cloneable Github repository
	if the issue is complex. For more complex questions sometimes it's hard to get all of the context
	required to solve a problem by just looking at text.

* **New Features**: If you'd like to work on a feature for the PDFTk wrapper,
  start by creating a 'Feature Design: Title' issue. This will let people bat it
  around a bit before you send a full blown pull request. Also, you can create
  an issue to discuss a design even if you won't be working on it. Any
  collaboration is good! But please be patient :-).

* **Answer Questions!**: If you can help another user please do!

## TODO
1. Add testing
2. Wrap more options
